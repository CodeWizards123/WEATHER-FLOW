# User Guide to the Experimental Platform

*This is an expanded version of the initial ReadMe.md file, that elaborates on the usage of the experimental platform, specifically when plugging in future cutting-edge ST-GNN models.*

## Introduction

* Overview of the experimental platform
  * This experimental platform was initially created by Davidson for his Masters project at UCT. It not has become enhanced to be a clear, easy-to-use experimental platform for the cognitive systems lab, that's designed for future use in mind - thus making it customizable and extensible with code modularity maximized and code coupling minimized.
* Purpose and goals of the platform
  * Purpose of the platform is to serve as an easy experimental platform that's customizable, extendable and new models can be plugged in easily and evaluated against reputable baselines such as TCN and GWN.
* Brief explanation of neural networks, GWN, and TCN as baselines
